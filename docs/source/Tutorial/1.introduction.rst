Project Overview
------------------------

The ESP32S3 AI Chatbot is an intelligent voice interaction project based on the ESP32S3 microcontroller. This project integrates hardware modules such as the INMP441 microphone, MAX98357A amplifier and speaker, 128x32(IIC) OLED display, and buttons to create a smart assistant capable of natural language conversation with users.

This project combines edge computing and cloud AI capabilities to provide a smooth voice interaction experience, applicable to various scenarios such as smart home control, personal assistance, educational companionship, entertainment interaction, and more.

This project is based on `xiaozhi-esp32 <https://github.com/78/xiaozhi-esp32/blob/main/README_en.md>`_. If you want to add your own features, you can follow the documentation for secondary development.

Application Scenarios
----------------------

* **Smart Home Assistant**: Control smart devices, check weather, set reminders
* **Learning Companion**: Answer questions, provide learning resources, knowledge Q&A
* **Entertainment Interaction**: Tell stories, play games, offer music recommendations
* **Development Platform**: Test and develop AI applications, voice interaction prototype design
* **IoT Node**: Integrate into larger smart systems as an interactive interface
